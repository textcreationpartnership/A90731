         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

For we now too well (O LORDS) understand that we have grievously sinned, which hath made your Honours give us up a spoyle unto Robbers, <hi>viz.</hi> your <hi>Committees, Sequestrators, Excise-men</hi> and <hi>Pursuivants;</hi> besides, your severall instruments of torments, distinguished by the various names of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, Lieutenant Colonels, Majors, Captains, Quartermasters, and a certain sort of putredinous vermin that you use to line hedges withal, vulgarly called; <hi>Dragoons, Troopers,</hi> and the like, O Lords, these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides your continuall Taxes, Collections, Assesments, and the like; a burthen that breaks our backs and very hearts, which continually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one on the neck of another, besides your excises on our very flesh and apparell, with every particular belonging to our trades and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhoods: Our wives, our daughters, our sons, our houses, our beds, our apparell, our horses, our hey, our beeves, our mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, our lambs, our pigs, our geese, our capons, and the rest of our goods are forced from us, upon free quarter as they call it: Had wee

What alteration of Estates, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, subversion of three flourishing Kingdoms, slaughtering of his Majesties Subjects, destroying of Cities, and confusion of all Order, that it is almost incredible that so many and so strange calamities could befall so happy a people as wee lately were in so short a space. We humbly beseech you to consider these our just plaints, and speedily let us enjoy our King, our Religion, our Laws, our just Liberties and Estates, lest the anger of the Lord take harnesse, and arm all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the revenge of his enemies, he shall put on justice for his brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, and shall take for his Helmet certain judgement.
